# 00s-Hit-Predictor-Model

Title: Hit or Miss? (2000's Hit Predictor Model)

Context:

The purpose of the data visualizarion model is to predict whether a track would be a hit or not, based on multiple factors (i.e. danceability, energy, speechiness, liveness, valence, and target).

(Note: The author does not objectively consider a track inferior, bad or a failure if its labeled 'Miss'. 'Miss' here merely implies that it is not a song that probably could not be considered popular in the mainstream.)

Tech/Framework:

-Python
-Bokeh (ridgeplot model)
-Pandas
